This is a quick script I made to remind me what to do.
It logs into google keep and scapes the website for the correct note and then texts it to you at your specified time.

Requirements:
- Twilio library
- schedule library
- Selenium library
- BeautifulSoup 4

Edits will have to be made on line 45 of Reminder_Funcs to get the right note

Note: This project doesn't really work atm. It works fine on my laptop but fails on my RPI. Not 100% sure why and I unfortunatly don't have the time to fix this project atm.
