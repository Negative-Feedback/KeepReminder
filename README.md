This is a quick script I made to remind me what to do.
It logs into google keep and scapes the website for the correct note and then texts it to you at your specified time.

Requirements:
Twilio library
schedule library
Selenium library
Beautiful Soup

Edits will have to be made on line 45 to get the right note
